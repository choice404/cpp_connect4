# cpp_connect4
A simple connect 4 game I made using c++ that can be played in the terminal


## How to compile and play the game

If you're on linux, mac, or are using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), download g++
> sudo apt-get install g++

Then go to the directory with the files in it in your console, then do the following commands
> g++ main.cpp
>
> ./a.out

and the game will run in the terminal

If you're on Windows however, there you can compile a version that uses unbuffered inputs so you can use the arrow keys to control the game instead
For this version you MUST use windows

First down load MinGW and install g++ through that

Then go to the directory with the files in it in the command prompt, then do the following commands
> g++ windowsMain.cpp
>
> a.exe

Or you can go into the folder after it compiles and double click on a.exe and it will bring up the game.

You can now play the game and control it using the arrow keys.



I'm still adding more things to it so yeah! Enjoy :)
